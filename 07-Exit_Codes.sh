# Each and every action in linux code will have exit codes
# Exit code ranges from 0 to 255
# Code 0 represents the success of last command
# code 1-255 represents either partial success, partial failure or complete failure

# 0         : Global Success
# 1 - 125   : Some failure in the commands
# 125+      : System Failure


# Exit codes also play key role in debugging big scripts
